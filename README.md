# ReadMe Documentation for Assignment 3

## Ethan Yeung

This assignment contains 4 functions that implement a queue.

+ There is a queue creation function to create an array, different variables, and some mutexes and conditional variables.
+ There is a queue deletion function to delete and free all dynamically allocated memory.
+ There is a queue push function that adds items to the queue in a thread-safe manner.
+ There is a queue pop function that removes items from the queue in a thread-safe manner.

This assignment also contains a Makefile to compile the code and create an object file.

And of course, there's also a README file (aka this file).
